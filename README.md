# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This is my dedicated cybersecurity portfolio site, showcasing incident reports, network analysis projects, and security research. The site includes live demonstrations of network incident analysis, highlighting technical skills in TCP/HTTP, DNS/ICMP, and threat identification.

## Objective
Provide a professional overview of cybersecurity work, demonstrating:
- Network incident analysis
- Log interpretation and reporting
- Security problem-solving skills

## Projects
1. **TCP SYN Flood Analysis**  
   [View Live Report](https://msamon00.github.io/syn-flood-incident/)  
   Analysis of a TCP SYN flood attack, including TCP/HTTP log review and server impact assessment.

2. **DNS / ICMP Incident Report**  
   [View Live Report](https://msamon00.github.io/tcpdump-incident/)  
   Network traffic analysis using tcpdump to diagnose DNS/ICMP failures and identify causes of service inaccessibility.

3. **Future Projects**  
   Additional security-focused projects and analyses will be added over time.
